```{r}
library(raster) #general raster package
library(rgdal) #spatial R package that helps us get metadata on rasters. Attribute information
library(ggplot2) #ploting raster and vector data in R
library(dplyr) #workhorse of wrangling data. Filter, adding new colomns, etc
library(here)

#saving information about the raster

#image with metadata attached to it

summary(DSM_HARV)
#tells us information about quartile summary of DSM_HARV but only generates a sample of the data

summary(DSM_HARV, maxsamp = ncell(DSM_HARV))
#tells us summary of all the data, ncell returns the number of cells of the input raster

#rasters must be converted into a data frame in order to be used in ggplot
DSM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_HARV, xy = TRUE)
#xy = true tells us that the columns are the xy cords

str(DSM_HARV_df)
#tells us structure of object

#ggplot allows us to add different graphs (histograms, graphs, etc)
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df, aes(x=x, y=y, fill= HARV_dsmCrop)) + #aes() fills rows and cols in raster
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + #colorblind friendly
  coord_quickmap() #sets a coordinate set so everything plots properly

raster::metadata(DSM_HARV) #sometimes tell us the metadata (more detailed information about understand a particular map)

plot(DSM_HARV) #more simple way to just take a quick look at the data

crs(DSM_HARV)
# proj=utm: the projection is UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator), UTM has several zones.
# zone=18: the zone is 18
# datum=WGS84: the datum is WGS84 (the datum refers to the 0,0 reference for the coordinate system used in the projection)
# units=m: the units for the coordinates are in meters
# ellps=WGS84: the ellipsoid (how the earthâ€™s roundness is calculated) for the data is WGS84

minValue(DSM_HARV)
maxValue(DSM_HARV)

nlayers(DSM_HARV)
#how many bands does our raster have
#note that when you run the raster data above it only loads the first band
#certain pixel values have no data which is labeled as NoDataValue and is given a specific raster value which should be ignored
